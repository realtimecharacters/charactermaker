# maybe separate texture / integument plugins are the way to go
# could be applied on a per-vertex group basis to target body areas
# these plugins use a combination of texture nodes, displacement maps,
# and particle systems to create integumentary structures
# such as scales, wrinkles, hair, fur, feathers, spines, etc.
# should be able to map vertex group values to any exposed property (feather length, etc.)
# could have multiple vertex groups interacting with a single plugin
# need way to quickly visualize and edit vertex groups
# explore using textures instead of vertex groups to give more detailed control

# figure out how integument animations should work (vertex animations?)
# do we turn on physics interactions to add realism?

# need to figure out how human hair styles and facial hair can be made easier
