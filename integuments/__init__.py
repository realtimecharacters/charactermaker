# maybe separate texture / integument plugins are the way to go
# could be applied on a per-vertex group basis to target body areas
# these plugins use a combination of texture nodes, displacement maps,
# and particle systems to create integumentary structures
# such as scales, wrinkles, hair, fur, feathers, spines, etc.
