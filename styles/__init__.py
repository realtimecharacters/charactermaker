# styles are like modifiers that happen in the final stages of creation
# they are a type of modifier that allow taking what's already defined
# and nudging certain parameters for a given effect
# examples of styles
    # baby (big head, eyes, small hands, chubby, etc.)
    # chubby / thin
    # manga
    # toon
    # edgy / angular
    # robot

# styles should be represented by a series of sliders
# these sliders will apply the various modifiers
# in specified amounts for the given effect

# different types of modifiers
    # handle modifiers run before generating meshes (proportion changes like baby, obese, or ripped)
    # mesh modifiers run during vertex creation (ex: pudgy, skinny, ripped, etc.)
    # texture/material modifiers run before and after texture node creation (toon, manga, realistic, grunge/dirty, wet, etc.)
    # rig modifiers?
    # animation modifiers run after animations have been created (ex: zombie mode, ninja stealth mode, etc.)
    # apparel modifiers run before and after apparel creation (more steps needed?)

# modifiers should be limited in number at first
# need to differentiate when something should be a new type of thing or just a modifier

# do multiple styles get made available on the market?
# are styles sold individually?
