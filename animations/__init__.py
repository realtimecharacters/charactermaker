# need to figure out how this should work
# probably need to classify appendages based on a type
# arms vs legs vs wings vs ears/eyes/mouth, etc.
# then animations can include behaviors for each type
# animations could include configurable parameters with them

# need to figure out how to specify animations that scale to various body types
# bipedal, quadropedial, multi-pedal (insects) all need to work
# how to handle appendages that are arm-legs (can function as either)

# need to figure out a way to share and sell animations like mixamo does
